ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HolgerGraef

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded software, IoT and semiconductor physics

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and C++11

I am German ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª but I have lived in France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· for about ten years now. I currently work for Parrot Drones ğŸ¦œ in Paris as
an embedded software developer, both on low level driver development in C and higher level projects in C++11.

Before turning towards embedded software, I studied physics and completed my PhD in 2019. During this time, I developed
the [Mercury Sample Manager](https://github.com/HolgerGraef/MSM), a web app that is now deployed in two laboratories
in the Paris area to help researchers keep track of their semiconductor samples and measurements.

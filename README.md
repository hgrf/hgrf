👋 Hi, I’m @HolgerGraef

👀 I’m interested in embedded software, IoT and semiconductor physics

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and C++11

I am German 🇩🇪 but I have lived in France 🇫🇷 for about ten years now. I currently work for Parrot Drones 🦜 in Paris as
an embedded software developer, both on low level driver development in C and higher level projects in C++11.

Before turning towards embedded software, I studied physics and completed my PhD in 2019. During this time, I developed
the [Mercury Sample Manager](https://holgergraef.github.io/MSM/), a web app that is now deployed in several laboratories
in France, Germany and Switzerland.
